## blank.yml

The example config file for GitHub Actions for automatic building and deploying a site to Github Pages.

**The required file location:**
```
.github/workflows/blank.yml
```


How it works (in general):
- Fires on a commit to `master` branch
- Installs the dependencies with `npm ci` and build the project with `npm run build`
- Copies `dist/` folder to the temporal `.gh-pages` (default) folder
- Inits the Git in this folder
- Pulls commit history (if exists) for the branch that is used as a source for Github Pages â€“ `gh-pages` (default)
- Checks is it the last commit and are there changes, and if it's true, commits the changes with `Deploy` (default) message and pushes it to `gh-pages` (default) branch.
