## Vue.js GitHub Actions deploy config to GitHub Pages

Vue.js example config for automatic builing and deploing of an application to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions.

What you need to do:

1. Create `.github/workflows/blank.yml` file.
    - _Like it is in [this repo](https://github.com/AlttiRi/vue-gh-pages-deploy-config)_
2. Fill it with [the follow content](https://github.com/AlttiRi/vue-gh-pages-deploy-config/blob/master/.github/workflows/blank.yml).
3. Make a commit and push it to GitHub.
    - _Now the GitHub will start to use the config._
4. Do any additional commit and push it to GitHub to trigger GitHub Action. 
    - _It will create `.gh-pages` branch with the built application content (the `dist` folder)._    
    - _Do not forgot to add to git `package-lock.json` file, since the script uses `npm ci`._
    - _You should see the follow:_

5. Now go to the Settings (`/settings/pages`) of your GitHub repository and select `gh-pages` branch as for GitHub Pages.

6. A few moments later...

7. The built application will be available at the URL like this one:
    - https://alttiri.github.io/vue-gh-pages-deploy-config/

How the action works (in general):
- Fires on a commit to `master`/`main` branch
- Installs the dependencies with `npm ci` and build the project with `npm run build`
- Copies `dist/` folder to the temporal `.gh-pages` (default) folder
- Inits the Git in this folder
- Pulls commit history (if exists) for the branch that is used as a source for Github Pages â€“ `gh-pages` (default)
- Checks is it the last commit and are there changes, and if it's true, commits the changes with `Deploy` (default) message and pushes it to `gh-pages` (default) branch.
